            In the United States alone, there are an estimated 11.6 million
            children living below the poverty line. For these families,
            purchasing school supplies is not something that fits in their
            budget.

            , 1 in 3 parents of school-age children expect to go into debt when
            shopping for back-to-school supplies. For parents with children
            attending schools that require hybrid learning due to the pandemic,
            42% believe they'll go in debt while paying for school supplies.

            What about the teachers?
          </h3>
          <p className="font-thin">
            The national average that teachers spend on classroom supplies is
            around $750 of their own money every year. 30% of teachers spend
            $1000 or more on supplies.</p>

            <br></br>
            <p className="font-thin">
            Sadly, teachers can only deduct a maximum of $250 dollars with the
            Educator Expense Deduction each year. As an already underpaid profession, it's
            unacceptable that we ask teachers to keep spending their own money. We can do better.
