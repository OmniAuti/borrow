      <p>
        The goal of this website is to not only bring awareness to the poor funding that
        many schools throughout the country experience and to help the families
        that can't afford supplies for their children.
        <br></br>
        The Goverment has failed us. <br></br>
        The school boards have failed us. <br></br>
        The teacher's unions have faild us. <br></br>

        The job is up local communities to help out those that need ask for it.
